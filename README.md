# ME5416_Final - Underwater robotic arm design
Download all and runing 'main_3R' or 'main_2R', you can see the control effect of the robotic arm.

# File Descriptions
- **`kinematics.m`**  
  Used to compute the necessary parameters for the PD control program.
- **`manip_animation.m`**  
  Used to generate an animation of the control results.
- **`main_2R.m` / `main_3R.m`**  
  Implements inverse kinematics and the PD control algorithm for 2-DOF and 3-DOF robotic arms, respectively.
- **`examples/`**  
  Contains parameter settings for the 2R and 3R robotic manipulators and the underwater environment.
- **`param/`**  
  Stores the output parameter results computed by `kinematics.m`.
